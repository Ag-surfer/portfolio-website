## About Section Structure

### The HERO Framework
- **H**ook: One compelling sentence
- **E**xperience: Your journey
- **R**eason: Why you do this
- **O**utside: Personal touch

### Template
```markdown
## About Me

[Hook - 1 sentence that captures attention]

### My Journey
[2-3 sentences about your background and how you got here]

### How I Work
[Your approach, philosophy, or what makes you different]

### Beyond Code
[Personal interests, hobbies, what makes you human]

### Currently
[What you're working on, learning, or excited about]
```

### Example
```markdown
## About Me

I believe the best digital experiences are invisible — they just work.

### My Journey
I started building websites in high school, teaching myself HTML in 
the school library. That curiosity led me through a CS degree at 
Stanford and five years crafting products at companies like Airbnb 
and Notion.

### How I Work
I obsess over the details. Every interaction, every animation, every 
error message is an opportunity to make someone's day a little better. 
I combine technical depth with design sensibility to build products 
that are both beautiful and bulletproof.

### Beyond Code
When I'm not pushing pixels, you'll find me hiking the Bay Area 
trails, attempting (and failing) at watercolor painting, or hunting 
for the perfect bowl of ramen.

### Currently
I'm exploring the intersection of AI and design systems, building 
tools that help designers work smarter.

## Project Descriptions

### The STAR Format
- **S**ituation: Context and challenge
- **T**ask: Your specific role
- **A**ction: What you did
- **R**esult: Measurable outcome

### Template
```markdown
## [Project Name]

### Overview
[1-2 sentences describing the project]

### The Challenge
[What problem needed solving? Who was it for?]

### My Role
[What did you specifically do?]

### The Approach
[How did you solve it? Key decisions made]

### Key Features
- [Feature 1]: [Brief benefit]
- [Feature 2]: [Brief benefit]
- [Feature 3]: [Brief benefit]

### Results
[Metrics, outcomes, or impact]

### Tech Stack

### Example
```markdown
## Notion Clone

### Overview
A full-featured collaborative workspace built to understand 
complex state management at scale.

### The Challenge
Notion's block-based editor is deceptively complex. I wanted 
to understand how to build real-time collaboration, nested 
content structures, and a fluid editing experience.

### My Role
Solo developer — designed, built, and deployed the entire 
application over 3 months.

### The Approach
Started with the data model, building a recursive block 
structure that could handle infinite nesting. Added real-time 
sync using Liveblocks, then focused on making the editor feel 
native with careful attention to keyboard shortcuts and 
drag-and-drop.

### Key Features
- **Block-based editing**: Nested pages, toggles, callouts, code blocks
- **Real-time collaboration**: See others' cursors and changes instantly
- **Slash commands**: Quick insertion of any block type
- **Markdown support**: Write naturally, format automatically

### Results
- 2,000+ GitHub stars
- Featured in React Newsletter
- 50ms average latency for sync

### Tech Stack
Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, Prisma, PostgreSQL, Liveblocks

## Voice & Tone Guidelines

### Do
- Be conversational but professional
- Use "I" and "you" — it's personal
- Show confidence without arrogance
- Be specific with numbers and details
- Write in active voice
- Keep sentences short

### Don't
- Use jargon or buzzwords
- Be vague ("various projects")
- Sound corporate or stiff
- Over-promise or exaggerate
- Use passive voice
- Write walls of text

### Word Swaps
| Instead of | Use |
|------------|-----|
| Utilized | Used |
| Leverage | Use |
| Synergy | Teamwork |
| Innovative | New, fresh |
| Solutions | Products, tools |
| Experienced professional | I've worked on |
| Passionate about | I love, I enjoy |

## SEO-Friendly Copy Tips

1. **Front-load keywords** — Put important terms early in titles and descriptions
2. **Use natural language** — Write for humans first, search engines second
3. **Be specific** — "React dashboard for analytics" > "web application"
4. **Include locations** — If relevant to your work
5. **Use descriptive link text** — "View the project" > "Click here"
